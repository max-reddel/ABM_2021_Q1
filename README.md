SEN1211 Agent-Based Modelling 2021/22 Q1. Final project

## Authors
This project was conducted by Max Reddel, Felicitas Reddel, and Sherman Lee.

## Structure

There are 4 main folders: Images, Notebooks, OutputData, and Scripts.

In Notebooks are two core notebooks, Main.ipynb to run the experiments and collect all data, and Output_Visualisation for plotting, data, and running with animation.

The Scripts folder contains all Python scripts that are necessary to create the model, the experiment, and the animations.

The OutputData folder contains saved pickle files of simulation outputs from Main.ipynb, and are used for Output_Visualisation.

The Images folder contains the relevant images that are converted to the map which the agents would navigate through.
## How to run a simulation 

In the Notebooks folder, there is a Main.ipynb file. If you execute the code below "Run an animation", a visualization will be executed, and you can see the simulation in your browswer.

## How to run an experiment 

In the Notebooks folder, there is a Main.ipynb file. The first section, "Run Experiments" has

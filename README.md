## Authors
This project was conducted by Max Reddel, Felicitas Reddel, and Sherman Lee.

## Structure

There three main folders: Images, Notebooks, and Scripts.

The Scripts folder contains all python scripts that are necessary to create the model, the experiment, and the animations.

The Main.ipynb in Notebooks can be run to run the experiment, receive all plots, data, and to run the animation.

## How to run a simulation 

In the Notebooks folder, there is a Main.ipynb file. If you execute the code below "Run an animation", a visualization will be executed, and you can see the simulation in your browswer.

## How to run an experiment 

In the Notebooks folder, there is a Main.ipynb file. If you execute the code below "Run experiments", the experiment will be executed. The relevant parameters are visible and can be changed by the user.
